**JMD is a general purpose Java bytecode deobfuscation tool**

## Travis CI
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/contra/JMD.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/contra/JMD)

## Project Status

JMD has been discontinued due to lack of time and was last updated November 24, 2010.
I will continue to monitor this repository so feel free to submit pull requests/issues at any time and I'll try to help you out.
Obfuscators update often (at least the good ones do) with new algorithms and techniques so it is more than possible some of the transformers will crash or break code.

## Usage

        java -jar JMD.jar <jarfile location> <transformer name> <debug true/false> <transformer specific args>

JMDGUI.exe provides an optional frontend to the command line interface.

## Examples

    Remove ZKM obfuscation: java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" zkm true
    Remove Allatori obfuscation: java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" allatori true
    Remove Allatori-Strong obfuscation: java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" allatori-strong true
    Remove JShrink obfuscation: java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" jshrink true
    Remove DashO obfuscation: java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" dasho true
    Remove SmokeScreen obfuscation: java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" smokescreen true
    Remove Generic String obfuscation: java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" genericstringdeobfuscator true
        
    Find all instances of example.com: java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" stringscanner "example.com" true
    Replace all instances of example.com: java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" stringreplacer "example.com" true "rscbunlocked.net"
    Renamer (currently breaks code): java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" renamer true
    Correct stack issues: java -jar JMD.jar "C:/Files/Magic.jar" stackfixer true
